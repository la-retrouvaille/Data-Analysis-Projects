## ‚ú® Project Overview

### Situation:

Airbnb's growth in popularity has increased the focus on designing regulations to limit the number of properties listed in each city. 

### Goal: 

Leadership has asked to analyze Paris listings, with a focus on pricing, and to assess how the 2015 regulations impacted the Paris market.

### Tasks:

- Profile & QA the data: import the raw listings, cast date columns, filter for Paris, select key columns, and check for missing values & summary statistics.
- Prepare for visualization: create aggregated tables by neighborhood, accommodations, and host year.
- Visualize & derive insights: plot average prices by neighborhood and accommodates, chart new hosts & prices over time, and interpret the impact of regulations.

> *Note: As the raw listings data was too big to upload on github, I've only uploaded the Paris sample. However the whole overview along with any step can be found on `AirBnB_Listings_Analysis_notebook.ipynb`*

## üîç Key Findings

- **√âlys√©e as most expensive neighbourhood**  

The √âlys√©e district tops the list at ‚Ç¨210.54, followed by Louvre (‚Ç¨175.38) and Passy (‚Ç¨161.14). This concentration in the city center reflects premium demand and limited supply in historic arrondissements.

- **Relationship between capacity and price**
  
There's a strong positive relationship between capacity and price. Studios (1 guest) average ‚Ç¨79.52, two-guest flats hit ‚Ç¨155.10, four‚Äëguest apartments ‚Ç¨212.10, and larger units (6-8 guests) climb to ‚Ç¨356-‚Ç¨406.

- **New Hosts & Average Price Over Time**

  - Host registrations rose steadily from 4 in 2008 to a peak of 12,147 in 2015. After the 2015 regulatory changes, new listings dropped ~27%, falling to 8,871 in 2016.

  - Prices were around ‚Ç¨100 in 2014, ticked up to ‚Ç¨103 in 2015, and then climbed further into the ‚Ç¨130-‚Ç¨140 range by 2018-2020, indicating that while supply growth slowed, pricing power remained strong.

- **2015 Regulations Lead to Fewer New Hosts, Higher Prices**

 Host growth sharply declines post-regulation, yet average prices continue an upward trajectory; highlighting that regulatory caps constrained supply without depressing price levels.
